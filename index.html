<p>Been studying for a number of years, interested in investing, video and tabletop games, fitness and 
singing opera songs in the shower. A fun fact about me is that I was abused as a child.</p>


<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>The reason why I have chosen to study Information Technology at RMIT is because it is the future. Moving forwards, handling technology, wrangling code 
and protecting information will be the most valuable skills because they will be what the world revolves around. This area of expertise interests me 
because I am interested at being the forefront of human development, but most of all I am interested in money and the most valuable skills in the world 
will be a good way to get it I should think. After graduation I hope to get a high paying job which will require me to have speciality skills so that I 
can save up capital for my own IT related business which will hopefully utilise the speciality skills I have picked up. </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

</p>

<p>
This position involves overseeing a server and maintaining it at a senior level. This job is appealing to me because running servers are mostly bludge jobs
with the employee only needing to do something when something goes wrong. This sort of job is ideal for me, as I dont want to working for someone else my 
entire life, so I can use downtime to work on my own projects. I also enjoy being a goblin in the walls and running a server allows you to do that.  
The requirements for this job include scripting knowledge, server maintenance program knowledge and experience running servers.  

The knowledge and skills I currently have are minute, but I have some experience coding in python and SQL. I have also tinkered with database security. 

To get the skills necessary to obtain this job it would be appropriate to run my own server, get an entry level job in databases and work on my own projects in
python to achieve mastery.

<h2>Myers Briggs Test Results</h2>
<img src="MyersBriggs.PNG" alt="" width ="200" height = "180"></div>
<p>The myer briggs test is pseudoscience and as such means as much to me as any other psuedoscience. Like a horoscope it contains universal nuggets of truth about most
people so is often too general to be super useful. As a unique person I think that it is far more important to define oneself and not live by a creed set by an arbitrary
set of questions. The results of the myers briggs test says things like I spend more time thinking about idealistic dreams over reality - I choose what I think about and
do not actively try not to waste time thinking about things that do not have utility. These results mean that I have more of an enhancing personality personality over a
driving one. Someone else can lead while I ensure their success. 

In a team setting, my results would influence me to make sure that the team is working together well and getting results that will get us a good grade.

When forming a team I would incorporate this knowlege by picking someone passionate and logical and other motivated people. I would then make sure they stay the course
and check up on them to ensure that their results are satisfactory from a mediatory standpoint. I should keep in mind that others may prioritze better, but I may have better
macro direction ideas. This is of course based on my Myer Briggs results </p>


<h2>Learning Style Quiz</h2>
<img src="Tactile.PNG" alt="" width ="200" height = "180"></div>
<p>The results of the test say I am a tactile learner, and that rings true in my head. I learn by doing and the test results reflect that. To me, tactile learning means jumping
in and making mistakes. After every mistake you iterate and then you have experience and knowledge.

In a team setting, it is likely that I will want to do work immediately rather than waiting and planning. Teammates may have a problem with this if they are planners. 

I should take this into account when planning a team and try and group with people who value agile development over beaureaucratic commiserating. 
</p>

<h2> Big 5 Personality Test</h2>
<img src="Big5.PNG" alt="" width ="200" height = "180"></div>
<p> These results assure me that I am extremely average. I may have less discipline then the average person and be slightly more agreeable and neurotic, but I am close to being
the default 21 year old male. This means that I have as good a chance as anyone else my age to make something of my life, which pleases me.

Neurotic thinking will help me when I am working in a team, because I will make ensure the checks and balances are correct out of pure fear. 

I should incorporate the results of this test into my teambuilding strat by picking other normal boring people so I have fellows to relate to.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to create a game in unity that incorporates elements from the pokemon game franchise and turns them into a product that challenges, entertains and is
aimed at an adult audience. There is room in gamer’s lives for an update to the pokemon formula and it is not currently being fulfilled by anyone, not even pokemon’s developers. 
The core components of tactical battling, catching, raising and training of fantastical pets are enthralling; and I am certain it will be a great joy to bring these exciting and 
satisfying elements back to the forefront, updated and better than ever. 
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Gamers the world over, especially players of pokemon, have consistently expressed weariness towards GameFreak's inability to improve the pokemon formula. They want so badly to 
play and enjoy a pokemon game, but are found wanting when they realise that they are still being designed to appeal to children. The appealing aspects of pokemon are also 
entertaining to adults, but GameFreak refuses to capitalise on this and is stick with a decades old formula they refuse to deviate from. Developing a good version of pokemon 
provides on opportunity to not be constrained by gamefreaks desire to make money over art, and create something truly fun and engaging for an audience that is not being capitalised 
on. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The game will have similar fundamentals to any pokemon game. An overworld will be available to explore which will be utilised to provide a place to obtain monsters for the player's
collection/team. In the overworld segment of the game, the player will control their character from a top down isometric perspective and will control their character primarily using 
the WASD keys. While walking around in the overworld, the player will be able to interact and examine objects and people; this is how they will be able to discover the secrets of 
the lands they will be travelling to. These lands, which will be varied in environment and foliage, will contain the monsters that can be tamed and battled. They will be encountered 
semi randomly; they will appear in the environment of the overworld as tiny sprites and when run into will trigger an encounter with the player. Some monsters will not be able to be 
obtained without triggering encounters with other monsters, to give players a reason to revisit old areas and grind encounters to look for a desirable monster. Players will form 
parties of six and do battle with wild monsters and non player characters. Strategic battle will play out in turn based combat on a grid made up of randomly generated terrain. Each 
monster will have unique strengths and weaknesses, including but not limited to movements speed, movement priority, range, physical power, magical power, area of effect and reflexes. 
Each monster will have unique abilities, powers and combat strategies which will make assembling a team and a gameplan engaging. Aesthetically, each monster will have a standout look
 to be visually appealing and to immerse the player into the game. The whole game will have a realistic and wild look to it, to emphasise the fact that monsters and human must survive 
 in this world. Not all monsters are large and hulking however. Some are small and tricksy, others nimble and timid.  The jungles will be menacing and looming, the swamps putrid and
 unforgiving, the deserts vast and treacherous and any human civilisation forms magical bastions against the grand creatures of this world. Shamans, wizards and friendly neighborhood 
 oracles are insurance against the mighty outside beasts, with deep trenches and artillery being useful physical deterrents against the larger roaming monsters. The player character 
 is not magically or scientifically gifted however – rather they have an understanding of the bond that all things in this world share and the equal role that monsters play in the
 makeup of the universe. Using hired dimensional doors, the player can keep their creatures in a plethora of habitats, teach them useful and interesting moves and abilities and bring 
 them along on the adventure of a lifetime. The story will answer the question of where monsters and humans came from and what happened before the beginning of the universe. It will 
 also test the player character by putting them up against unsurpassed evil and seeing whether their resolve and morals will hold to the last breath. When put up against power 
 unimagined with no sight of victory, how will the mortal and finite player character respond?
</p>

<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>
Hardware wise, I will need a computer with a high amount of ram for 3d modelling. Software wise I will require a 3D modelling program such as Blender or Maya, the game engine Unity, 
version control through Github and a solid text editor such as notepad++ for writing dialaogue. Photoshop will be used to touch up and create textures and art for the game. A cloud 
service will also be used such us onedrive or google drive to keep all lore and story information collated; essentially a bible for the continuity of the games universe. This will
include concepts, story beats and history. 
</p>

<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>
Skills will involves knowledge of the C# language for using Unity, the knowledge of how a game engine works and the ability to create renders in a 3d modelling program. Writing skills 
will also be useful along with competency in creating art, even if the art style allows for a relative beginner to create it. Management skills will also come into play, so the project 
is organised and follows a realistic schedule. It would be feasible to pick up all these skills myself given enough time, but for a  more feasible solution it would be wise to hire 
artists for the visual and audio components of the game creation. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>
Once the game is in a partial state of completion, it would be feasible to show it off to the public. An early build of the game release would be excellent marketing and would 
generate the beginnings of a community, a community being one of the most powerful tools in fostering a fanbase. Making back the time and money put into the project is an important
part of any venture and getting the game exposure will be a big component of that. The final product should be a big hit with the older crowd that used to like pokemon as children 
and with fans of good video games anywhere.
