<h1>Connor Logan</h1>

<h2> s3768929 - connor.j.logan@outlook.com</h2>

<p>Been studying for a number of years, interested in investing, video and tabletop games, fitness and 
singing opera songs in the shower. A fun fact about me is that I was abused as a child.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>The reason why I have chosen to study Information Technology at RMIT is because it is the future. Moving forwards, handling technology, wrangling code 
and protecting information will be the most valuable skills because they will be what the world revolves around. This area of expertise interests me 
because I am interested at being the forefront of human development, but most of all I am interested in money and the most valuable skills in the world 
will be a good way to get it I should think. After graduation I hope to get a high paying job which will require me to have speciality skills so that I 
can save up capital for my own IT related business which will hopefully utilise the speciality skills I have picked up. </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
