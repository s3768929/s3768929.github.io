<h1>Connor Logan</h1>

<h2> s3768929 - connor.j.logan@outlook.com</h2>

<p>Been studying for a number of years, interested in investing, video and tabletop games, fitness and 
singing opera songs in the shower. A fun fact about me is that I was abused as a child.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>The reason why I have chosen to study Information Technology at RMIT is because it is the future. Moving forwards, handling technology, wrangling code 
and protecting information will be the most valuable skills because they will be what the world revolves around. This area of expertise interests me 
because I am interested at being the forefront of human development, but most of all I am interested in money and the most valuable skills in the world 
will be a good way to get it I should think. After graduation I hope to get a high paying job which will require me to have speciality skills so that I 
can save up capital for my own IT related business which will hopefully utilise the speciality skills I have picked up. </p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

</p>

<p>
This position involves overseeing a server and maintaining it at a senior level. This job is appealing to me because running servers are mostly bludge jobs
with the employee only needing to do something when something goes wrong. This sort of job is ideal for me, as I dont want to working for someone else my 
entire life, so I can use downtime to work on my own projects. I also enjoy being a goblin in the walls and running a server allows you to do that.  
The requirements for this job include scripting knowledge, server maintenance program knowledge and experience running servers.  

The knowledge and skills I currently have are minute, but I have some experience coding in python and SQL. I have also tinkered with database security. 

To get the skills necessary to obtain this job it would be appropriate to run my own server, get an entry level job in databases and work on my own projects in
python to achieve mastery.

<h2>Myers Briggs Test Results</h2>
<img src="MyersBriggs.PNG" alt="" width ="200" height = "180"></div>
<p>The myer briggs test is pseudoscience and as such means as much to me as any other psuedoscience. Like a horoscope it contains universal nuggets of truth about most
people so is often too general to be super useful. As a unique person I think that it is far more important to define oneself and not live by a creed set by an arbitrary
set of questions. The results of the myers briggs test says things like I spend more time thinking about idealistic dreams over reality - I choose what I think about and
do not actively try not to waste time thinking about things that do not have utility. These results mean that I have more of an enhancing personality personality over a
driving one. Someone else can lead while I ensure their success. 

In a team setting, my results would influence me to make sure that the team is working together well and getting results that will get us a good grade.

When forming a team I would incorporate this knowlege by picking someone passionate and logical and other motivated people. I would then make sure they stay the course
and check up on them to ensure that their results are satisfactory from a mediatory standpoint. I should keep in mind that others may prioritze better, but I may have better
macro direction ideas. This is of course based on my Myer Briggs results </p>


<h2>Learning Style Quiz</h2>
<img src="Tactile.PNG" alt="" width ="200" height = "180"></div>
<p>The results of the test say I am a tactile learner, and that rings true in my head. I learn by doing and the test results reflect that. To me, tactile learning means jumping
in and making mistakes. After every mistake you iterate and then you have experience and knowledge.

In a team setting, it is likely that I will want to do work immediately rather than waiting and planning. Teammates may have a problem with this if they are planners. 

I should take this into account when planning a team and try and group with people who value agile development over beaureaucratic commiserating. 
</p>

<h2> Big 5 Personality Test</h2>
<img src="Big5.PNG" alt="" width ="200" height = "180"></div>
<p> These results assure me that I am extremely average. I may have less discipline then the average person and be slightly more agreeable and neurotic, but I am close to being
the default 21 year old male. This means that I have as good a chance as anyone else my age to make something of my life, which pleases me.

Neurotic thinking will help me when I am working in a team, because I will make ensure the checks and balances are correct out of pure fear. 

I should incorporate the results of this test into my teambuilding strat by picking other normal boring people so I have fellows to relate to.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The aim of this project is to create a game in unity that incorporates elements from the pokemon game franchise and turns them into a product that challenges, entertains and is
aimed at an adult audience. There is room in gamer’s lives for an update to the pokemon formula and it is not currently being fulfilled by anyone, not even pokemon’s developers. 
The core components of tactical battling, catching, raising and training of fantastical pets are enthralling; and I am certain it will be a great joy to bring these exciting and 
satisfying elements back to the forefront, updated and better than ever. 
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>Gamers the world over, especially players of pokemon, have consistently expressed weariness towards GameFreak's inability to improve the pokemon formula. They want so badly to 
play and enjoy a pokemon game, but are found wanting when they realise that they are still being designed to appeal to children. The appealing aspects of pokemon are also 
entertaining to adults, but GameFreak refuses to capitalise on this and is stick with a decades old formula they refuse to deviate from. Developing a good version of pokemon 
provides on opportunity to not be constrained by gamefreaks desire to make money over art, and create something truly fun and engaging for an audience that is not being capitalised 
on. </p>
